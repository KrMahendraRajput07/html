              lthough most of the economy of Rajasthan is based on agriculture, this part of the state is rich in mineral resources. 
              The area is one of the prime Indian suppliers of marble, granite and other valuable varieties of stone. The Dariba,
              Sindesar khurd and Zawar mines are the principal Indian sources of ores for zinc, silver, manganese, etc.
